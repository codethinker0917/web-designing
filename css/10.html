	The concept of education is misunderstood my many students. Students want to study in order to make money and become rich so that they can fulfill their wants. Similarly money is invested by parents in terms of the amount of investment it will reap in the future. Because of this reason females are not given much higher education in our country. Teachers nowadays also opt colleges and schools where they do not have to give daily lectures and can make double earning by college salaries and personal home tuitions.

I wonder thinking what is my countryâ€™s future is going to be like if this continues to happen. Careers are opted solely on the basis of high salaries. Those who fail to pass the examinations easily purchases the degrees. Fortunately my college has a very strict discipline regarding the marking scheme. All those who do not perform well are made to repeat the exams to make sure that they acquire deep knowledge about the subjects
